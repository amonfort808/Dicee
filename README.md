# Dicee

A Las Vegas dice app. You can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking your phone. 

## Objective of App

The objective is to build upon fundamental navigation within xcode and comfortably create a new project. This also includes familiarizing myself with the following:
* Utilizing the Interface Builder to design the appearance of the app
* Navigating through the storyboard
* Changing attributes of various UI elements
* Setting UI elements by coordinates
* Mastering the use of constants, variables, and arrays
* Learning about the randomisation method
